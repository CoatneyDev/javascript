## Build & Run

<br />
Build DEVELOPMENT project:

`$ npm run dev`

Then in another terminal...

`$ npm run startdev`

<br /><br />

alternatively, for PRODUCTION

`$ npm run build`

Then in another terminal...

`$ npm run startprod`

<br /><br />
### NOTE: Don't chain the build and serve commands or it won't work correctly.
### NOTE: Using WSL2 and liveserver or webpack dev server interferes with hot reloading.
(Use a REAL server, or via WSL2 + node, to overcome the challenge)

<br /><br />
## Dev vs Prod
Dev uses hot reload when changes are detected (but manual refresh if WSL2!) while Prod builds final codebase but doesn't watch for changes.
